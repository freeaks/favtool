# favtool
a small gui in python3 using tkinter, ttk, pyfav.
it takes an url and a site name, automatically grabs the favicon, base64 encode it,
and then create a DB file holding all the links.
an html file is generated from the DB file.
the result is 1 single file containing all links with their favicons.
i know, it just blew your mind, the world will never be the same.
